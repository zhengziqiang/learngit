% How to use Overleaf: 
%
% You edit the source code here on the left, and the preview on the
% right shows you the result within a few seconds.
%
% Bookmark this page and share the URL with your co-authors. They can
% edit at the same time!
%
% You can upload figures, bibliographies, custom classes and
% styles using the files menu.

\section{Using chemistry packages with \LaTeX{}}

\subsection{Chemical equations with \texttt{mhchem}}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Chemical equations with \texttt{mhchem}}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \texttt{mhchem} package lets you write chemical equations in \LaTeX{} with the minimum of effort. 
\item The example below shows how the standard representation of a reaction (on the left) is created from the simple code on the right:
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\ce{CO2 + C -> 2CO} is created with \verb|\ce{CO2 + C -> 2CO}|
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item More complicated reactions are still easy to write:
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\ce{SO4^2- + Ba^2+ -> BaSO4 v}\\[0.1cm]
is created with\\[0.1cm]
\verb|\ce{SO4^2- + Ba^2+ -> BaSO4 v}|
\end{center}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Getting started with some \texttt{chemfig} coffee}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Getting started with some \texttt{chemfig} coffee}

It's easy to use the \texttt{chemfig} package for drawing complex molecules:

\vskip 0.5cm

\begin{center}\small\setatomsep{2.0em}
\schemestart  
\chemfig{*6((=O)-N(-CH_3)-*5(-N=-N(-CH_3)-=)--(=O)-N(-H_3C)-)}
\schemestop
\end{center}

This is the caffeine molecule, represented clearly and neatly, and built from a single line of text: \small{\verb|\chemfig{*6((=O)-N(-CH_3)-*5(-N=-N(-CH_3)-=)--(=O)-N(-H_3C)-)}|}\\[0.3cm]

If that looks quite daunting, we can learn from simpler molecules\dots{}how about a single water molecule?

\end{frame}

\subsection{Experiments with water and rings}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Experiments with water and rings}

To see how the \texttt{chemfig} package creates the drawings from your code, let us look at the simple water molecule:

\vskip 0.3cm
\begin{center} 
\chemfig{H_2O} is created with \verb|\chemfig{H_2O}|
\end{center}

The simple \LaTeX{} code on the right is automatically converted into the molecular formula for water on the left. 
\vskip 0.3cm
Rings are similarly easy to code - consider the examples below:

\vskip 0.3cm

\chemfig[][scale=0.5]{A*5(-B-C-D-E-)} = \verb|\chemfig{A*5(-B-C-D-E-)}|

\vskip 0.3cm

\chemfig[][scale=0.5]{*6(=-=-=-)} = \verb|\chemfig{*6(=-=-=-)}|


\end{frame}

\section{Where to go next\dots{}}

\begin{frame}{Where to go next\dots{}}

\begin{itemize}
\item This short example was designed to introduce you to using Overleaf for scientific presentations.
\item This is made possible by the many great packages that have been developed for \LaTeX{}, including the two we focused on here (plus the \texttt{Beamer} package used for the overall presentation style). 
\item For more help on using \LaTeX{}, see the links on the Overleaf help page: \url{www.overleaf.com/help} or check out our free introductory course: \url{www.overleaf.com/blog/7}.
